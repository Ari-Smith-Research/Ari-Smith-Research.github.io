I am a Ph.D. student at UW-Madison (since Fall 2019) in the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a doctoral minor in Science and Technology Studies, under the advising of professor Justin Boutilier. My academic interests include critical algorithm studies, sociotechnical infrastructures of algorithms and fairness in public policy and democratic theory, feminist philosophies of science and technology, and relations between preference, agency, and subject formation in systems of humans and optimization technologies.

Current projects are focused on:
 - inverse optimization as a method of observing/framing congressional gerrymandering
 - machine learning for predicting hospital emergency department crowding, and model transferability/drift across settings affected by covid-19
 - feminist technoscience analyses of the infrastructures and deployments of preference elicitation algorithms.
  
In relation with these projects, I am currently an honorary appointee at UW Madison's Department of Emergency Medicine, a data science intern at UW Health Enterprise Analytics, and a Graduate Student Affiliate at the Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies.

I TA or have previously TA'd:

- ISyE 323: Operations Research Deterministic Models, Spring 2022
- ISyE 521: Machine Learning in Action for Industrial Engineers, Fall 2021, Fall 2022
- the equivalent ML course ISyE 601, Fall 2020

Prior education:

- Oberlin College, B.A. in Math, minor in Computer Science, 2019
- Oberlin Conservatory, B.Mus. in Jazz Studies (Bass Performance), with secondary study in Classical Composition, 2019
