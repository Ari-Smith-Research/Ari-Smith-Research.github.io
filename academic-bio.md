I recently completed my Ph.D. at UW-Madison in the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a doctoral minor in Science and Technology Studies, under the advising of professor Justin Boutilier. My academic interests include; methods and applications in inverse optimization, with a focus on fairness and positive societal impact; critical algorithms studies; preference elicitation models and recommender systems; machine learning and fair decision-making.

Current research projects are focused on:
 - inverse optimization as a method of observing/framing congressional gerrymandering
 - inverse optimization as a method for detecting imbalanced training sets in machine learning models
 - developement of a recommender system for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias

Education:

- Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering, minor in Science and Technology Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 2025
- B.A. in Math, minor in Computer Science, Oberlin College, 2019
- B.Mus. in Jazz Studies (Bass Performance), with secondary study in Classical Composition, Oberlin Conservatory, 2019
